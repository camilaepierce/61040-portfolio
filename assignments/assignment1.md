# Assignment 1: Problem Framing

## Domains
1. **Dorm (Community aspect)**  
    I am currently, as of writing this, External President of my dorm, Baker House. Being in this position, I have an interest in improving the lives of Baker residents, whether that be from daily operations in Baker to building community among the residents. I would like for Baker House to be a welcoming place for both under and upper classmen, and to serve as a home away from home.
3. Swimming
4. **Student Government**  
    I am a member of several student groups, and there is so much 
5. Class Overload (aka drinking from the firehose)
6. Making Art
7. Reading Books
8. **Exploring Nature** (touching grass, getting outside of Boston)
9. Talking to People (professional yappage) ((aka network building))
10. Cooking (when outside of a dining hall dorm)
11. Making Coffee (and drinking coffee)

## Problems
Chosen Domains:
1. Dorm  
    1. **Using Desk Resources** - we keep a number of items behind desk, available for checkout, but it is difficult to know what items specifically, as well as which ones are checked out
        - *Selected*: This has been a major complaint amongst desk workers and Exec members. Desk workers because the StarRez system is notoriously difficult to work with: looking for a specific item even just to check out requires scrolling to that item, with no way to type a segment and have the matching items appear, which should be a simple feature. For exec members, it is difficult (or impossible, unsure) to find out who last checked out an item and when, which means that items go missing rather frequently. Among just a few items from last year that grew legs and disappeared were one or two sets of spikeball, a vaccuum, and a sewing machine. This causes a heavy financial strain on Baker Exec, which I am a member of, so it would be great to distribute money more wisely.
    2. **Visual Baker-Forum** Keeping track of events, action items, etc., outside of constantly checking email / needing to be an a particular mailing list
        - *Selected*: Although it would be lovely for residents to care enough to use a third tool to keep track of Baker-specific events, this could be solved simply enough with a Google Calendar (and would be, if people downloaded and followed the calendar). However, there is not a super simple way to get resident-hosted events on the Baker Calendar, other than a member of Exec being incredibly mindful with what emails reach their inbox. It might be useful for residents to be able to post their own events that are open to everybody, and might encourage residents to use some more of the resources that are provided to them, such as Room Funds, which are meant to help people build community with their own ideas.
    3. Occupation of Public Rooms - There are a handful of rooms within Baker such as the music room, or dance studio, among others. 
        - *Unselected*: This is a relatively small issue, as all of the spaces could be easily checked by walking down. Additionally, this feature could be enveloped within a broader room reservation service, much like how the MIT libraries do room reservations of their own.
2. Student Government
    1. **Conveying Student Group Meeting and Purpose Information** Too many sources of student government, and most students aren't really sure what each one does
        - *Selected*: A single, centralized location for keeping track of meetings, notes, and general sense of how the club is run (elections, open to all, etc.). Furthermore, this could be expanded to include more student groups, outside of 'government'. There is currently a page on Engage that lists all of the student groups on campus (which is out of the way and not good at displaying secondary information), and a project by SIPB that intercepts and displays Dormspam, but that along with Midway mean that most of the groups students hear about are by chance. I believe this problem is very widespread, albeit not incredibly serious. Most clubs look for new members, and are hardpressed to get their message across to eager new students outside of dormspam.
    2. Student government groups themselves have trouble keeping track what each other group is working on
        - *Unselected*: This problem could more easily be solved through better communication, Slack channels, etc. There is not necessarily a specific need for more software to connect these groups.
    3. There is a lot of lost knowledge post-Covid, so often people have no idea what resources they can access, or which admin members they should talk to that would best help their goals
        - *Unselected*: In order for this to work and be useful, I think that this would require a lot more than just software. This kind of generational, wealth of knowledge would require a lot of participants, and ideally upheld by student groups and accurate transitions between years.
3. Exploring Nature
    1. Difficult to find reachable places
        - *Unselected*: I think this would be helpful to have an evolving list somewhere, there simply isn't enough time during the school year to explore outside of campus / the general Boston area.
    2. Difficult to get outside of the city
        - *Unselected*: Although there are a handful of ways to reach outside the city, this information could be conveyed through a PDF document (commuter rail, Zip car, etc) and would not necesarily benefit from entertwining Google Maps with 
    3. Usually a better idea to go with other people, might be difficult to find those people
        - *Unselected*: This seems like something that could be solved by a club, such as the Outdoors Club, or by contacting people online, etc., not necessarily something that requires an app. Additionally, there is no guarantee that your experience would be enjoyable, and risking the several hours of your day that an adventure outside would take for it to not be a good time would not serve the users well.

## Stakeholders
1. Using Desk Resources
    1. Baker Residents
    2. Baker Exec
    3. Baker Desk  
    This would help residents through making Baker Desk items more readily available, and simplify the role of desk workers. This would alleviate the strain on the Exec treasurer, as we would not need to replace these items as often.
2. Visual Baker-Forum
    1. Baker Residents
    2. Baker Exec
    3. Baker Houseteam  
    Residents would be able to post their own events that they want pubbed to Baker, and be able to see all of the upcoming events laid out. Exec would likely get a higher level of attendance at their events, as would the Houseteam. However, having such a public access to this might leave it open for abuse, such as if students wanted to put on a harmful or inappropriate event, which the Houseteam might not be keen on.
3. Student Group Meetings
    1. Active Group Members
    2. Potential Group Members
    2. Association of Student Activities (ASA)  
    This is something the ASA might want to implement, as their role is to support student groups, and encourage students to join clubs that they are passionate about and interested in. This would help connect student groups with their potential new members, and facilitate interaction between these two groups.
## Evidence
1. Using Desk Resources
    1. [The current](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gA92fgad2eIxMV5dTOpuTS3CuUy0Vt8-pWIUVAHlhCQ/edit?tab=t.0) Baker desk inventory is old and out of date, currently only a Google Docs. It provides no extra information on what resources are available.
    2. [The website](https://sites.google.com/view/bakerhousemit/facilities?authuser=0) also has this information halfway down in a tab titled 'Facilities', which does not lead to easy finding unless well acquainted with the website.
    3. [The Zesiger Center](https://www.mitrecsports.com/visit/rentals-and-reservations/) has some information on space rentals, but no information on individual items for rent.
    5. [U-Haul Truck rentals](https://www.uhaul.com/Locations/Truck-Rentals-near-Cambridge-MA-02139/837051/) might be a comparable site, though the information about specific items would likely need to be more visible about availability from the get-go, and we could not offer advance scheduling of rentals.
    6. [Boston Public Library Catalog](https://www.bpl.org/) would also be something that could be a comparable from the desk-workers side, as items would need to be searched up similar to books. Additionally, the two sides (front and back) would be visually different, hence to two inspirations.
1. Visual Baker-Forum
    1. [Dormsoup](https://dormsoup.mit.edu/) would be a comparable tool, though it is for all events posted to dormspam, not for just Baker-forum.
    2. [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r) would also be a comparable tool, but it would not be feasible to allow posting permission for all that use the calendar
    3. [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) would likely be the most comparable of these tools, though it would need to be user-authenticated, as there could be personal information posted (names, addressed, etc) that should not be made public
    4. [Guide to Residences](https://mitguidetoresidences.mit.edu/index.php/residences/baker-house) A major benefit of MIT's dorm systems is the strong sense of community that they bring. This community is only supported through events that are easily accessible by members of the dorm.
    5. [MIT Admissions Blog](https://mitadmissions.org/blogs/entry/how-dorm-structure-shapes-social-life/) also boasts about how essential dorm culture is to the experience at MIT, which is built through dorm events.
    6. [Room Party Funds](sites.google.com/view/bakerhousemit/about?authuser=0) in the Welcome Packet, Baker Exec encourages residents to host room parties to build community within Baker. This tool would help promote that culture.
1. Student Group Meetings
    1. [Engage](https://engage.mit.edu/club_signup) list of clubs, 368 organizations, does not have a ton of information about individual clubs, not enough parameters to search through.
    2. [ASA Homepage](https://asa.mit.edu/) 
    3. [ASA Advertising Methods](https://asa.mit.edu/advertisingpublicity/asa-bulletin-boards/)
    4. [Clubs leading to careers](https://www.usnews.com/education/articles/how-college-clubs-can-lead-to-careers) through finding new passions, or making networking connections that will help you down the line.
    5. [The MIT Student Organization Handbook](https://studentlife.mit.edu/app/uploads/2025/03/sole-handbook.pdf) itself says that clubs at MIT are integral to personal development and making connections while at school.
    6. [College post on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/college/comments/9bb2qc/how_do_i_join_a_club_cc/) shows that in most schools, clubs are joinable through club fairs or emailing current members to indicate interest. This shows there there is an available niche for helping bridge the gap between students and clubs looking for new members.
    7. [College Data](https://www.collegedata.com/resources/transition-to-college/how-to-navigate-college-clubs) provides some helpful tips for how to seek out and get into clubs on campus.
    4. [Dormsoup](https://dormsoup.mit.edu/) is a comparable tool, but not used for meeting times or clubs specifically, more so for general events around campus.

## Features
1. Using Desk Resources
    1. Two different interfaces, a normal front-end for the residents and a sort of back-end for the desk workers, that is dilineated by a log-in screen, so that information can only be changed by authorized sources.
    2. List of all of the resources, with indicators on which are currently checked in behind desk, so residents can easily tell if the item they are looking for is available or not
    3. Easy export / viewing of who has checked out items and when by authorized sources (desk workers), so if an item has gone missing for a distint amount of time, it can be tracked down.
1. Visual Baker-Forum
    1. Very visible weekly events-log, with bright and appealing themes that make the upcoming week easy to understand.
    2. The ability for residents to submit their own events to the system, maybe to be held for review before applying ? but will then update the site calendar with the information
    3. Scraping the baker-forum mailing list to see what events residents are pubbing, to be automatically added to the site calendar, removing the need for manual submission or checking of events. 
1. Student Group Meetings
    1. Interest-based selector, can filter groups based on topics, so if a student is interested in volunteering, they can look for clubs that primarily volunteer during their time, for example.
    2. Calendar showing weekly meeting times, which would help students figure out if they have time in their schedule for this club, or if the clubs they are interested in are overlapping
    3. Indicators showing whether positions in this group are based on elections, or if walk-ins or sit-ins for the club are welcome or are encouraged. This would help students plan around when they should be thinking about joining if they have to wait for elections, or if they can go at any time to get an idea of the club.
